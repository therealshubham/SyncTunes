## Project Summary

Our project will help Spotify users to gain insight into their listening habits and preferences and compare their taste music with their friends. Each Spotify user will be able to log in with Spotify and after the Spotify data gets imported the users will be able to see their  top artists,tracks and genres as part of their insight. Additionally each user will have a unique code. This unique code can be shared with a friend and a score on how compatible your music taste is will be displayed, together with a breakdown of which are the artists and songs in common.
